Verisettle – Solana-Powered Institutional Stablecoin Settlement Layer


## Overview

Verisettle is a Solana-based institutional settlement layer that enables banks, fintechs, and enterprises to perform instant, compliant, and low-cost stablecoin settlements across borders.
Built for financial institutions, Verisettle leverages Solana’s speed, composability, and low fees to deliver enterprise-grade payment infrastructure — bridging traditional finance with the efficiency of decentralized systems.

With Verisettle, institutions can settle invoices, payrolls, remittances, and treasury operations in seconds instead of days — using regulated stablecoins like USDC, EUROC, or local CBDC-backed tokens.


## Problem Statement

Today’s institutional settlement systems are slow, fragmented, and expensive.
Cross-border transfers can take days, cost up to 8% in fees, and require multiple intermediaries.
Even blockchain solutions often lack compliance layers, privacy standards, and integration with existing financial systems.

Institutions face three major challenges:

1. Settlement Delays – Traditional rails (SWIFT, SEPA) take days to finalize.

2. Regulatory Pressure – Transparency vs. privacy remains a critical balance.

3. Security Concerns – Lack of audited infrastructure and custodial standards prevent large-scale adoption.


## Solution

Verisettle provides a compliant, programmable, and secure settlement layer on Solana designed specifically for institutional use.

It offers:

1. Stablecoin Settlement Layer – Instant cross-border settlements using Solana-native USDC and regulated stablecoins.

2. Compliance-Ready Privacy Framework – Uses zero-knowledge proofs to maintain regulatory transparency while preserving data confidentiality.

3. Custody-Grade Infrastructure – Multi-sig wallets and MPC-based transaction signing for institutional clients.

4. Auditable Settlement Logs – Each transaction generates encrypted proof records for auditing and compliance reporting.

5. API Integration – Plug-and-play APIs for banks and fintechs to integrate with existing core banking or ERP systems.


## Key Features

Instant Settlement – Transactions finalize in seconds on Solana’s high-throughput chain.

Regulatory Compliance – Supports KYC, AML, and GDPR frameworks via modular policy engines.

Privacy-Preserving Architecture – ZK-proofs hide sensitive data while allowing verification.

Stablecoin Support – Supports USDC, EUROC, and local Solana-issued tokens.

Auditability – Cryptographic proof logs for every transaction.

Interoperability – Designed for integration with DeFi, RWA, and CBDC systems.


## Roadmap

Q4 2025

Milestone: MVP & Core Settlement Engine
Tasks: Launch Solana-based settlement smart contracts, integrate USDC and EUROC, and onboard 2 pilot institutions.
Metrics: 1,000 transactions processed; <3s average settlement time.

Q1 2026

Milestone: Compliance & Custody Layer
Tasks: Deploy compliance module (KYC/AML + ZK framework), enable MPC-based custody wallets.
Metrics: 5 institutional partners, 100% KYC coverage, 0 data breaches.

Q2 2026

Milestone: Institutional Network Expansion
Tasks: Release Verisettle API suite, onboard cross-border fintechs and local payment providers.
Metrics: 10+ institutions onboarded; 25,000+ stablecoin settlements.


## Primary KPIs

1. Transaction Volume – ≥25,000 settlements by Q2 2026

2. Institutional Partners – ≥10 verified organizations onboarded

3. Settlement Success Rate – ≥99.5%

4. Compliance Adherence – 100% verified through ZK-audits

5. Security Incidents – 0 critical vulnerabilities post-audit


## Hackathon Alignment

Impact:
Addresses real-world financial inefficiencies by enabling regulated institutions to move funds faster, cheaper, and safer using Solana-based stablecoins.

Execution over Hype:
Functional MVP with institutional-grade compliance and privacy modules. Ready for live demo and audit evaluation.

Community & Mentorship Fit:
Verisettle aims to collaborate with Superteam mentors for regulatory design, custody infrastructure, and Solana optimization.

Blockchain Relevance:
Only possible on Solana — its parallel execution and sub-second finality make institutional settlements viable at scale.

Wow Factor:
Merges traditional banking security with Web3 composability. A decentralized SWIFT alternative, but faster, auditable, and cost-efficient.


## Technical Stack

Blockchain: Solana

Smart Contracts: Rust (Anchor Framework)

Compliance Engine: Zero-Knowledge + On-chain Policy Layer

Frontend: React / Next.js (Institutional Dashboard)

Custody: Multi-Party Computation (MPC) + Solana Multi-Sig

Data Storage: On-chain hashes + IPFS for encrypted audit proofs

APIs: REST & GraphQL for fintech integration


## How It Works

1. Institution Onboarding – Registered entities undergo KYC verification.

2. Stablecoin Settlement – Initiate transfers in USDC/EUROC with compliance pre-checks.

3. Private Verification – ZK proofs confirm compliance without exposing private data.

4. Auditable Logging – Encrypted proof of transaction recorded on-chain.

5. API Integration – Institutions embed Verisettle’s API into their existing payment rails.

Continuous vulnerability monitoring

Smart Contract Deployment (Solana Devnet)

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abdoolngw/Verisettle.git
cd Verisettle

# 2. Configure Solana CLI for devnet
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

# 3. Build the Anchor program
anchor build

# 4. Deploy smart contract to Solana devnet
anchor deploy

# 5. Save the program ID displayed after deployment


## Frontend Setup

# 1. Move to frontend folder
cd frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
yarn install

# 3. Configure environment variables
# (Create a .env file and add your Solana RPC + Program ID)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC=https://api.devnet.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID=<Your_Deployed_Program_ID>

# 4. Run local development server
yarn dev

Access the dashboard via http://localhost:3000

## API Integration (For Fintechs & Banks)

Verisettle provides REST and GraphQL APIs for seamless settlement automation.

Example API Call:

POST /api/settlement/initiate
{
  "from_wallet": "<sender_pubkey>",
  "to_wallet": "<receiver_pubkey>",
  "amount": "1000",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "reference": "invoice-98342",
  "zk_compliance_token": "<proof_hash>"
}

Response:

{
  "status": "success",
  "transaction_hash": "5wzH7D8QpYvAb9N9q8...",
  "settlement_time": "2.8s"
}
